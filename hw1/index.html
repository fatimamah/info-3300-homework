                <li>When checking type of null, the console will say

                    is a function in the console, it is actually type object.</li>

        Problem 3: Type coercion is a process that Javascript does when it encounters a comparison between two
        dissimilar things or when trying to use a particular thing as if it were a different type. Javascript then casts
        things into other types (coerces things into strings, numbers, and booleans, but never into objects) to try to
        make it work without throwing an error or exceptions like other languages such as Python would.
    <ul> Two examples of type coercion are:
        <li>When adding a number and a string. If I added the number 5 to the string "Fatima" in python, this should
            throw an error because I can't add a string to a number or concatenate a number to a string because they
            are two different types. In javascript, it makes the number 5 a string and prints the string "5Fatima".
        </li>
        <li>When adding a boolean and a number.If I added the boolean true to the number 4 in python, this should
            throw an error because they are two different types. In javascript, it makes the boolean true equal to
            the number 1 and adds that to 3 to print the number 4.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <script> console.log(5 + "Fatima");
        console.log(true + 4);</script>
    </p>

        Problem 4: Late and unreadable work will recieve a 0. Each student has 5 slip days for homework and will be
        automatically used when the assignment is graded. We can use up to 3 slip days for one assignment.
