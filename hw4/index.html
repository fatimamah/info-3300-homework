    <p id="A">
        Part A: The issues I found were: (1) points being strings so I converted them to numbers (2) price being strings
        so I converted them to numbers and took out commas and dollar signs (3) countries being "NA" or "N/A" so I
        filtered them out (4) points being negative so I filtered them out (5) regions being null/empty strings so I
        filtered out falsy values for region_1 and finally (6) I didn't see any negative prices, but just to make sure
        there weren't any, I filtered those out too. I removed 61 counts of bad data.
    </p>

    <p id="B">
        Part B: For the Y axis (points), I chose a linear scale because the range for points was 80-98 (min to max)
        which isn't really big. It doesn't jump from a small value to a really big value, so I think it would be linear.
        For the X axis (price), I chose a logarithmic scale because the range is 10 to 225. That is a really big range
        so I assumed it was logarithmic and when I graphed the circles in part c, that was confirmed because the graph
        was a lot less cluttered when the x axis was logarithmic. I tried it as a linear scale, and a lot of the points
        were clustered near the beg. of the x axis and then huge jumps to the end of the x-axis which indicates to me
        that log scale was a good choice. I also changed the labels for the x axis to have a dollar sign, 0 decimals
        (because they were all integers), and the SI prefixes because they're prices.
        For the
        colors (based on state), I chose an ordinal scale because it is quantitative. It is states ordered into colors.
        I chose the d3.schemeCategory10 because I thought it would be good because it tries to find good colors that
        work for different types of colorblindness. The gridlines are light gray so the colors of the circles are seen
        and so it is easy to look at. I put .lower() for the gridlines so they would be below the circles and not above.
    </p>
    <p id="C">
        Part C: I made the radius 4 because that looked like a good size--not too small and not too large. I didn't add
        a stroke because I felt that would make the graph really cluttered and confusing. I made the opacity 0.7 because
        even after the jittering, there was still overlap and the opacity helped a bit. Going lower than .7 opacity
        however made the circles look really faded.
        One advantage to using the jittering approach is that I can see where the density of the data is and understand
        the relationship between the x and y better just from looking at the graph. One disadvantage to using the
        jittering approach is that the circles are not completly correct because its been slightly changed by a random
        number.
    </p>
    <p id="D">
        Part D: The possible benefits to this approach is that a user will be able to see the titles of the wines
        clearly just by picking a circle and that by making it so clear which circle they picked, they can distinguish
        between circles that are overlapped..
        The place in the chart where it can be confusing/ineffective is the highest circle in the graph (index 655)
        because it is right at where the title is shown. The text and the circle overlap and it causes some flickering
        when moving slightly away from the circle to read the title better. It also just blocks a part of the text when
        looking at other circles' titles.
